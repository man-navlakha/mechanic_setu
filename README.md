## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Request Assistance:** Users select their vehicle issue (e.g., puncture) and share their location via the app.
2. **Matching:** Our system identifies the nearest verified "Setu Partner" mechanics.
3. **Real-time Tracking:** Once a mechanic accepts, users can track their arrival in real-time.
4. **Instant Repair:** The mechanic arrives at the user's location to fix the issue on the spot.

## 🌟 How It Helps
* **For Vehicle Owners:** Eliminates the stress of searching for a garage while stranded. It provides transparent pricing and fast response times.
* **For Mechanics:** Acts as a powerful customer acquisition channel, helping local shops grow their business digitally.
* **Safety & Trust:** All partners are verified, ensuring a secure experience for the user.
